Technologies Used:

Excel: Data storage, basic data manipulation.
SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

Data Collection (Excel):

A six-month dataset is stored in an Excel workbook. The data includes daily sales records, customer feedback, product details, and transaction timestamps.
The Excel file serves as the primary data source for analysis, with raw data structured into tables for easy reference and manipulation.
Data Preprocessing (SQL):

SQL queries are used to clean, filter, and aggregate the data. The key SQL commands include:
SELECT to extract relevant data columns.
JOIN to merge tables based on common keys, such as product ID or date.
GROUP BY and SUM to aggregate sales by categories like product type, day, or week.
WHERE to filter out irrelevant records, such as incomplete sales data.
DATE_FORMAT to adjust time-series data for weekly or monthly analysis.
Data Analysis (Power BI):

The cleaned and aggregated data is imported into Power BI to build the interactive dashboard.
Key metrics visualized include:
Sales Trends over six months using line charts.
Product Performance with bar charts comparing sales across different products.
Customer Insights through heat maps or pie charts.
Top-selling items and Sales by region, using slicers to allow filtering by time and category.
The dashboard includes custom measures like Month-over-Month Growth, Average Sale Value, and Customer Retention Rate.
Interactive features allow users to filter data by date, product, or customer demographic.
